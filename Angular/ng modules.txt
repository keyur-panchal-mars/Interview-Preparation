 
Angular Modules:
	- Modules are way to organize and manage related components, services, directives, and other code units.
	- Modules help developers encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability and maintainability.
	- Angular application has at least one module, the root module, which is usually named AppModule
	Structure:
		- The @NgModule decorator takes a metadata object that defines the module's properties
		Ex: @NgModule({
			  declarations: [
				AppComponent, // Components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module
			  ],
			  imports: [
				BrowserModule, // Other modules whose exported classes are needed in the component templates of this module
			  ],
			  providers: [
				// Services available to this module
			  ],
			  bootstrap: [AppComponent] // The root component that Angular creates and inserts into the index.html host web page
			})
			export class AppModule {}
