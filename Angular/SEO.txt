SEO 
	Title/Meta from platform Browser:
		- Use Angularâ€™s Meta and Title services to dynamically set meta tags for different routes.
		Ex: constructor(private meta: Meta, private title: Title) and use instance's methods.
	Dynamic Title via routes:
		Ex: { path: 'login', component: LoginComponent, title: 'Login' }
    Also the SSR and hydration are more useful to index websites.
