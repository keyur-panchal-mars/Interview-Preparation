type coercion Falsy Values and  == && === testing equality.
 
	There are only six falsy values : false,0,"",null,undefined,NaN. 
		Comparing false,0 and "" are equals to each other.
		Comparing null and undefined, they are only equal to themselves and each other.
		NaN is not equivalent to anything. Even cooler, itâ€™s not even itself!
