What is hoisting in javascript ?
- Hoisting is a concept or behavior in JavaScript where the declaration of a function, variable, 
  or class goes to the top of the scope they were defined in.
- Defined in global scope.
- If it is defined and access it before initalization we get the undefined value. If variable is not defined and access it gets error "not defined".
- Remember, variables are hoisted but only to the top of the scope they were declared in.
