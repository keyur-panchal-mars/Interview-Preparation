What is diff between let var and const.
- Var is functional scope else window/ global means if no function then it will be global.
- Let and const are block scope. Means in {}
- Let and var both hoisted. 
- We can use var before defining. It will give undefined. 	
- We can not use let and const before defining. Will give error of "initalization".
- Default value of let is also undefined.
- Const must require the value during defining.
- We can redeclare same variable with var in any scope. We can't redeclare variable with let and const, Gives  SyntaxError "Already assigned or declared error".

What is "temporal dead zone"
- When accessing assigned variable with let and const gives error and known as "TDZ".
