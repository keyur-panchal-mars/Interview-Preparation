What is closures 
- A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
- Lexical environment is when outer function variable is used by inner function or scope.
- A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the inner function has access to the outer function variable.
	Ex: 
		function createPerson() {
			let name;
 
			return {
				getName() {
					return name;
				},
				setName(newName) {
					name = newName;
				}
			};
		}
 
		const person = createPerson();
		console.log(person.getName()); // Should initially print: undefined
		person.setName('Charlie');
		console.log(person.getName()); // Should print: "Charlie"
