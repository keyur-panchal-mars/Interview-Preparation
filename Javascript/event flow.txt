Event flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which an event is received and handled in the DOM (Document Object Model) tree 
when a user interacts with a webpage (like clicking a button inside a div).

Capturing Phase:   document → body → div → button
Target Phase:      button (event fires here)
Bubbling Phase:    button → div → body → document
